This repository contains the Dronuts implementation from Andy Gao, Joyce Chen, and Jonathan Fung. All code was written for the Carnegie Mellon University course 17-356, Software Engineering for Startups (https://cmu-17-356.github.io/).

### How to run the application locally and via docker-compose (e.g. development vs production variations as well)
The application can be run in development mode locally by using `npm start` to run both the server and client for our web app. These can be accessed by their respective directories in the repo. To view the web app in browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000. The page will reload if you make edits.

Running `npm run build` will create an optimized production build for the app, which is minified and has the filenames hashed.

### Make and deploy changes through Travis CI
Commits are automatically built through Travis CI, the Continuous Integration Tool used for this project. This tests to ensure that the code can build correctly, before allowing any changes to be pushed to the repo.

### Deploy on Azure VMs

### How to run linting, tests, and npm-cleanup scripts/tools
